# Data protection

The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously.
Personal data are all data that can be related to you personally, such as name, address, email addresses, and user behavior (information referring to an identifiable natural person (Art. 4, No. 1 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR))).

Controller according to Art. 4, par. 7 GDPR is the President of KIT, Professor Dr.-Ing. Holger Hanselka, Kaiserstrasse 12, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany, [info@kit.edu](mailto:info@kit.edu) (see Legals). Our Data Protection Commissioner can be contacted at [datenschutzbeauftragter@kit.edu](datenschutzbeauftragter@kit.edu) or by ordinary mail with “Die Datenschutzbeauftragte” (the data protection commissioner) being indicated on the envelope.

When you contact us by electronic mail, the data given by you (your email address and, if applicable, your name and your phone number) will be stored by us to answer your questions. The data arising in this connection will be erased as soon as storage will no longer be required or processing will be restricted, if legal obligations to retain the data exist.

We would like you to note that internet-based data transmission (e.g. when communicating by electronic mail) may have security gaps. Absolute protection of data against access by third parties may not be guaranteed.

# Hosting
Our hoster collects the following data transmitted by your browser in so-called log files:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request came and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.

There is no tracking and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymized statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.

We use the following hoster to make our website available:

GitHub Inc.
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St
San Francisco, CA 94107
United States

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f GDPR, not to have to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. Server location is USA.

For more information on objection and removal options vis-à-vis GitHub, please visit: (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages).

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful is to be determined in the context of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing ceases to apply.

The processing of the data provided under this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of individuals in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).
