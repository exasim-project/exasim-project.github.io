The exasim project is proud to announce a partnership with the exaFOAM project!

The projects share a common objective to enable exascale-capable CFD simulation using OpenFOAM, and explore complementary approaches. The exaFOAM project focuses on the development and validation of a range of algorithmic improvements, across the entire CFD process chain (preprocessing, simulation, I/O, post-processing).

Due to the commonality of objective and the complementarity of approaches, a link between the projects is a natural step. By sharing benchmarking test cases and findings, the collaboration will exploit synergies and increase the overall knowledge gained. We look forward to a fruitful collaboration!
