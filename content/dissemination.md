# Public Repositories

The exasim project supports the philosophy of open science and open source software. Software, benchmark cases, and performance data are therefore distributed on publicly available repositories.

## OGL
The OGL package is an OpenFOAM plugin that provides the interface to the sparse linear algebra framework Ginkgo.</br>
