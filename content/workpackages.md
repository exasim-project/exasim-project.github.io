## Project management **WP1**

## Definition and creation of test cases **WP2**

## Development of the OpenFOAM Ginkgo interface (_OGL_) **WP3**

Goal of WP3 is the implementation of an interface between OpenFOAM and the
sparse linear algebra framework Ginkgo, to provide access to state of the art
linear algebra methods and to significantly improve the performance and resource
efficiency on GPUs and current computer hardware. In order to maximize the user
base for this technique, the methods developed are intended to be platform and
manufacturer-independent. This means they are optimized for the three major
manufacturers of graphics cards: AMD, Intel and Nvidia, as well as for various
high-performance computers and cloud computing platforms.

## HPC capable inflow and outflow conditions **WP4**

## Complex application cases wind energy **WP5**

## Dissemination **WP6**
