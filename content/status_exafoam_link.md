The exasim project is proud to announce a partnership with the exaFOAM project!
The projects share a common objective to enable exascale-capable CFD simulation using OpenFOAM, however they explore different avenues to achieve this. In exaFOAM (would need some short description here)
Due to the commonality of objective and the complementarity of approaches, a link between the projects is a natural step. By sharing benchmarking test cases and findings, the collaboration will exploit synergies and increase the overall knowledge gained.
We look forward to a fruitful collaboration!
