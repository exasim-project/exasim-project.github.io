The exasim project is proud to announce a partnership with the exaFOAM project!

The projects share a common objective to enable exascale-capable CFD simulation
using OpenFOAM, and explore complementary approaches.  EXAFOAM focuses on the
development and validation of a range of algorithmic improvements, across the
entire CFD process chain (preprocessing, simulation, I/O, post-processing).

Due to the commonality of objective and the complementarity of approaches, a
link between the projects is a natural step. By sharing benchmarking test cases
and findings, the collaboration will exploit synergies and increase the overall
knowledge gained.  We look forward to a fruitful collaboration!
