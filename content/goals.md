High-resolution flow simulations are not only an academic field of research, but also an important part of the development processes in the wind industry, the automotive sector, and aerospace engineering, as well as an important tool for political decision-makers in the context of environmental and disaster protection. In this context, flow simulation replaces the costly and resource-intensive experimental evaluation of design decisions that are intended to improve product efficiency and performance, but also to reduce environmental impact. These flow simulations require enormous computational resources to represent turbulent flows in detail. However, many of the software libraries used for flow simulation are insufficiently or not at all prepared for modern, more energy-efficient high-performance computers. In the EXASIM project, we will close this technical gap and develop high resolution
power simulations on modern high-performance computers. For this purpose, we develop an interface between the popular simulation software OpenFOAM and the software library Ginkgo for linear algebra developed at KIT.

# Consortium

For the EXASIM project a consortium of the three partners SCC, ISTM and UCFD as well as two associated partners was chosen. The three partners contribute within their work packages (WP 2 to 5) to the fulfillment of the project.
of the project. In addition, two work packages for the organization (WP1, from own funds of the
project partners) and the dissemination and exploitation of the results (WP 6). The responsibility
for these work packages lies with the SCC. The associated partner ENERCON contributes by providing expertise and defining industrially relevant test cases and the associated partner Amazon Web Services (AWS)
by providing access to the AWS cloud platform for extensive scaling tests.
